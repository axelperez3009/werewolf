# Werewolf Game Project

This project is a text-based implementation of the classic party game Werewolf using C++ and its standard libraries.

## Description

Werewolf is a multiplayer role-playing game where players are assigned secret roles as villagers or werewolves. Villagers must work together to identify and eliminate the werewolves, while the werewolves aim to deceive the villagers and avoid detection.

This implementation includes the following features:
- Text-based gameplay with a command-line interface.
- Random assignment of roles (villager or werewolf) to players.
- Day and night cycles where players perform actions based on their roles.
- Player voting and elimination during the day phase.
- Win conditions for villagers and werewolves.
